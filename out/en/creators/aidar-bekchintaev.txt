9:T5bb,An&nbsp;interactive online museum where you can explore the subject and immerse yourself in&nbsp;the atmosphere of&nbsp;a&nbsp;real-life residential housing courtyard. 
<br><br>
Swans made of&nbsp;tires, Cheburashka made of&nbsp;bottles, stumps with eyes&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;the Bestiary section, you can see and get acquainted with the biographies of&nbsp;the outlandish ZHEK-art characters surrounding you.
<br><br>
Using the art constructor in&nbsp;the DIY section, you can create your unique work of&nbsp;ZHEK-art: download any background and assemble the character using the materials at&nbsp;hand. 
<br><br>
The Online Museum of&nbsp;ZHEK-art is&nbsp;a&nbsp;large-scale multidisciplinary project with bright typography, illustrations and 3D&nbsp;objects, animation and a&nbsp;360-degree panorama on&nbsp;the main page. The general message of&nbsp;the project is&nbsp;that even against the background of&nbsp;gray reality, there can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;place for bright original creativity, accessible to&nbsp;everyone and worth appreciating. 
<br><br>
As&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;large-scale PR&nbsp;campaign supporting the launch of&nbsp;the project, we&nbsp;collaborated with popular Internet artists: we&nbsp;modeled a&nbsp;LEGO set&nbsp;&mdash; dedicated to&nbsp;Russian ZHEK-art&nbsp;&mdash; with Oleg Lego, printed a&nbsp;comic with Vitaly Terletsky, released a&nbsp;limited edition merch with Nikita Gruzovik, and published an&nbsp;AR mask on&nbsp;Instagram.a:T523,We&nbsp;intended the special project to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform for love confessions, and for this purpose, we&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital Valentine card constructor on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated website. Everyone could create their own valentine and upload it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the gallery of&nbsp;romantic confessions. First of&nbsp;all, this is&nbsp;plain fun. Secondly, such UGC mechanics work well to&nbsp;engage a&nbsp;user in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dialog with the brand.
<br><br>
The participants participated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;raffle of&nbsp;NFT-arts by&nbsp;famous artists Ellen Sheidlin, Daria Fedorova, and Vladimir Vikhrov. We&nbsp;got our users to&nbsp;feel like the new Tretyakovs and Morozovs (renowned XIX-century Russian art collectors), and the project became more vivid and high-profile media-wise. So&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that even Paris Hilton liked an&nbsp;Instagram post about the project.
<br><br>
Just three days after the launch, there were <b>50,000</b> Valentine&rsquo;s cards in&nbsp;the gallery! <b>40%</b> of&nbsp;users who have left romantic confessions have activated promotional codes for VK&nbsp;Combo subscriptions, including discounts on&nbsp;taxi rides with Citymobil.&nbsp;<b>14</b>&nbsp;people received NFT cards. In&nbsp;total, more than <b>100,000</b> unique users visited the project page.b:T4f5,J&auml;germeister won&rsquo;t solve all problems, but it&nbsp;might inspire a&nbsp;creative solution. The legendary herbal liqueur is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer just a&nbsp;hunters&rsquo; festive drink but the sponsor of&nbsp;music awards and metropolitan parties, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;trendsetter in&nbsp;alcohol fashion.
<br><br>
We&nbsp;used visual elements as&nbsp;the core of&nbsp;the collaboration. The familiar label with a&nbsp;deer with a&nbsp;shining cross between its antlers is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;the legend of&nbsp;St. Hubert, the patron saint of&nbsp;hunters. We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;reinvent it&nbsp;by&nbsp;replacing the deer with a&nbsp;tiger, the symbol of&nbsp;our creative group, and the name with Tigermeister. The content remains the same: a&nbsp;<b>56</b>-ingredient recipe created in&nbsp;the town of&nbsp;Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, the sheer name of&nbsp;which sounds like alcohol being poured into a&nbsp;shot glass.
<br><br>
We&nbsp;released a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;500 bottles&nbsp;&mdash; so&nbsp;fashionable and rare that people started a&nbsp;hunt for them.
<br><br>
<b>300</b> bottles of&nbsp;Tigermeister were consumed on&nbsp;New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and we&nbsp;left another <b>200</b> for the Orthodox Christmas holiday in&nbsp;January.7:["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","$L8",null,{"locale":"en","messages":{"Index":{"Navigation":{"about":"About","projects":"Projects","services":"Services","creators":"Creators","contacts":"Contact us"},"Header":{"desc":"ethical digital agency"},"Cover":"Hi!
